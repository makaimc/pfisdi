Passion-Focus-Intensity-Solution-Distribution-Iteration (PFISDI)
================================================================

This open source Django application, pronounced "piff-siddy," combines
with the pfisdi-stats project to collect, report, and visualize metrics
for all your side project web applications in a central location.

Since pfisdi is open source, you can deploy it yourself on Heroku or
a virtual private server to make sure you retain control over your data.
